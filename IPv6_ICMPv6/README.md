# 1. Introduction
This document describes the format of a set of control messages used in ICMPv6.  It does not describe the procedures for using these messages to achieve functions like Path MTU discovery; these procedures are described in other documents (e.g., [PMTU](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8201)).  Other documents may also introduce additional ICMPv6 message types, such as Neighbor Discovery messages [IPv6-DISC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861), subject to the general rules for ICMPv6 messages given in Section 2 of this document.
